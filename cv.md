## Education
- PhD in Mechanical Engineering, University of Texas at Austin (expected December 2019)
- BASc in Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo (2013)

## Graduate work
- Graduate Research Assistant in real-time fMRI with Dr. James Sulzer and Dr. Jarrod Lewis-Peacock (2014-present)
    - Developed a framework to simulate how people learn to control fMRI signals in real-time ([Oblak et al., 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005681))
    - Validated this framework with an fMRI experiment where presses of individual fingers (index/middle/ring/little) could be decoded from 6 seconds of fMRI data ([Oblak et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.03.062))
    - Currently using real-time fMRI to train healthy people to shift the neural patterns associated with individual finger movements, with implications for stroke rehabilitation
- Teaching Assistant in Engineering Computational Methods (Fall 2013)

## Projects
- Real-time fMRI decoding tool: https://github.com/LewisPeacockLab/instabrain
    - Lightweight Python tool to decode brain states from fMRI in real-time and send the results to a separate feedback display computer
- MRI compatible keyboard: https://github.com/LewisPeacockLab/rewire-keyboard
    - Mechanical, electrical, and firmware design for force-sensitive keyboards with a simple USB interface
- Website for real-time fMRI community ([rtfin.org](http://www.rtfin.org/literature.html)): https://github.com/LewisPeacockLab/rtfin-lit
    - Operates using GitHub Pages and CircleCI to allow community members to submit literature to a repository through pull requests

## Skills

- Coding: Python, Matlab, Arduino (familiar with Unity/C#, C++, Ruby, Javascript, CSS)
- CAD: OnShape, Solidworks, EAGLE
- Graphics: Illustrator, Photoshop, Matplotlib
